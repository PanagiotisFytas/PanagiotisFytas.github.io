I am a second year PhD student at the [Language Technology Lab](https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk/) in the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). I am supervised by [Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/), and funded by [Harding Distinguished Postgraduate Scholars Programme](https://www.hardingscholars.fund.cam.ac.uk/).

My research interests include multimodal NLP, biomedical ML, explainable AI, representation learning, self-supervised learning, knowledge-augmented language models and causal inference. The focus of my PhD thesis is developing interpretable multimodal models to assist clinicians in their decision-making process.

I hold an MSc in Advanced Computing degree from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I graduated at the top of my class. Before that, I completed my diploma (BEng & MEng equivalent) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) in Greece.
